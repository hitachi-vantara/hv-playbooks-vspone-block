# Ansible Playbook: Auto-Expand High-Utilization LDEVs

## Overview

This Ansible playbook is designed to monitor LDEVs (Logical Devices) on a Hitachi VSP subsystem, identify those that exceed **80% utilization**, automatically expand their volume by **10%**, and notify the storage administrator via email.

It is intended to be scheduled as a **cron job**, providing automated storage management and proactive capacity handling based on real-time usage.

  1. Fetch LDEV details into `ldev_facts_results`
  2. Filter LDEVs with usage > 80%
  3. Expand their size by 10%
  4. Send an email to the storage admin with the following details:
